## Description


Subject (Player) can flip a card by clicking the “Flip a new card” button. 
At the top of the main screen, the cost and probability of success are displayed. In addition, the highest number ever found in the round is always displayed at the top middle of the screen and is initially zero.
There are 16 cards on the screen, but if subjects fliped whole 16 cards and still wish to continue, they can obtain 16 new cards by clicking “Flip a new card.” In such cases, the previous highest number is still displayed on the screen. Subjects can finish the round by clicking the “Finish” button at any time. At the end of the round, the highest number of cards minus the total search cost is recorded as the result of the round.
